"""Scanner interface for extensible detection backends.

Per ARCHITECTURE.md Section 8, the scanner uses an abstract interface
to support multiple detection backends:
- RegexScanner: Fast, regex-based (default for MVP)
- ASTScanner: Python AST analysis (Phase 2)
- SemgrepScanner: Semgrep integration (Phase 2)

    Implementations:
    - RegexScanner: Fast, regex-based (default for MVP)
    - ASTScanner: Python AST analysis (Phase 2)

    Design notes:
    - Regex is sufficient for detection tokens (exact matches)
    - Regex has known limitations for SQLi, XSS, SSRF (context-dependent)
    - Future backends can provide higher accuracy for complex patterns
